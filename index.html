Geography - 11-08-25

Eastern slopes:
    The Rangipo desert recieves 1200mm of rainfall per year, but resembles a desert because of poor soil quality and drying winds.

Western Slopes:
    Heavy rainfall of the Western region, as a result of orographic rainfall (3000mm)

Western Foothills:
    Area to the west of the mountains and the area on the southern slopes of Ruapehi recieves around 2200mm

Death Valley, a desert in the U.S. states of California and Nevada is so hot and dry because it's in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.
When there is flooding, river water is muddy because soil is being carried with it. When the river slows down, the soil is deposited in flood plains and deltas, which is good for farming.

Flooding:
    Heavy rainfall can cause flooding in different environments.
    In Jan 2025, Mecca experienced heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and hail. This resulted in significant disruptions and flooding, with some areas recieving over 40mm of rain in one day. The average for Mecca is 149.4mm.
